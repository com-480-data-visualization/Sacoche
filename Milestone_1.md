# Project : Milestone 1

**Due to 21st March, 5pm**

### Dataset
The dataset we are using is from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) website, which aggregates the data of all the finishers of the Boston Marathon from 2015 to 2017. The datas was extracted from the official marathon website.

### Problematic

Marathons are among the most grueling yet rewarding endurance races in the world, pushing athletes to their physical and mental limits. These events bring together runners of all backgrounds, from elite professionals chasing records to everyday enthusiasts fulfilling personal goals. With its rich history and global prestige, the Boston Marathon stands as one of the most iconic races, attracting thousands of qualified participants each year. Its challenging course, unpredictable New England weather, and passionate spectators make it a unique and highly anticipated event in the running community.

This project aims to explore data from the Boston Marathons held between 2015 and 2017 through a series of interactive visualizations. By analyzing key metrics such as split times (5K, 10K, Half, etc.), finishing times, demographics (age, gender, nationality), and rankings, we seek to answer several questions: How do factors like age and gender impact performance? What pacing strategies lead to the best results? Which countries and cities have the strongest representation? How accurately do projected times reflect actual race outcomes?

The goal of this project is to provide an engaging and accessible way to analyze marathon performance trends, helping runners, coaches, and enthusiasts gain deeper insights into what it takes to succeed in one of the worldâ€™s most famous races. Whether you're an aspiring Boston qualifier, a data enthusiast, or simply curious about the patterns behind marathon success, these visualizations will offer a new perspective on the race that has defined endurance running for over a century.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
